# 01.Propagating-Uncertainty-in-Dynamical-Systems

This experiment evaluates GP-LSTM's (Gaussian Process regression in combination with LSTM's) on their ability to forecast the predictive distribution of dynamical systems.

01.01 One Dimensional Random Walk

In a first step, the model performance is evaluated on a simple one dimensional random walk.
The GP-LSTM is trained for one-step-ahead predictions using a random walk with 1000 time steps.
